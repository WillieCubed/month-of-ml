# Month of ML
*Because I just couldn't take a break*

# About
I had a month between the end of first semester and the beginning of second
semester. This is what's happening during that break.

I was desperate to do ML, so I'm doing a few experiments now.

See [Month of ML](https://monthofml.williecubed.me) blog for more info.

It's the MIT license. Honestly, I could care less what you do with my stuff as
long as you credit me with a link to this repository or my website.
